# Harvester

A manual trading terminal with signals for Binance USDⓈ-M futures. Rust core, Tauri window, Vela charts,
draggable and re-arrangeable panels. Open source (AGPL-3.0-or-later). Windows. Testnet by default.

> Status: early but usable on the testnet. Working: tabbed charts, draggable panels, live QFL / drop **signals with thumbnails**,
> manual order entry, right-click orders on the chart, and the **ladder tool** (draw a range, set the number of orders, place them).
> **Pine Script** works per chart tab (146 indicators, `/` quick picker, editor). The Lab and the ML finder are on the roadmap (`docs/DESIGN.md`).

## Run

Prerequisites: Rust (stable), Node 20+, pnpm 9, WebView2 (included with Windows 11).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # opens the Harvester window
pnpm test         # cargo tests + UI tests
```

`HARVESTER_ENV=live` selects the live exchange (default: testnet). Market data needs no API key. To trade, copy `.env.example` to `.env`
and fill in the testnet keys (`BINANCE_TESTNET_API_KEY` / `BINANCE_TESTNET_API_SECRET`). Live trading needs separate `BINANCE_LIVE_*` keys.
A server-side cap (`MAX_ORDER_NOTIONAL`, default 5000 USDT) limits any single order.

## The ladder tool

Press **L**, click where the ladder starts, click where it ends, then set the number of orders with the slider.
Drag either end of the vertical line to adjust. Every order is rounded and validated against the symbol's
exchange limits before anything is sent.

## Pine Script

Every chart tab has a **Pine** button (top left of the chart) and a `/` quick picker (hover the chart and press `/`). The library holds
8 built-in indicators and 138 community scripts from everget's public TradingView collection, ported to Pine v6; each one is run by
`pnpm --dir ui test` so nothing in the list is a placeholder. Write or paste your own in the editor. Scripts are remembered per chart tab.

## Layout
